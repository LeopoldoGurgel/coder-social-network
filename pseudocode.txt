pseudocode for creation of backend with mongoDb/ mongoose

1- create and clone repo, with gitignore for node and readmefile to change it later.

2- create initial config, controllers, models, routes and utils folders.

3- in order to save those folders in github, they should not be empty. So create a js file in each of them with a comment describing what they will do. On the config folder, create a connection.js file. On models, a User.js file. On controllers, a userController.js file. On routes, a userRoutes.js file. On utils, a seed.js and a data.js files.

4- initiate node in your folder with <npm init>. That will create a package.json file.

5- Install the packages we are goint to use. Install express and mongoose as dependencies and nodemon as a devdependency (run <npm i nodemon -D> ) (nodemon will restart the server automatically whenever anything is changes in the backend files, so we dont need to be type npm start all the time.)
